# presentation-portfolio
This project was made for my semester examination and aimed to create our own presentationportfolio. Made for a specific target group, the website also had to be responsive and show our own qualifications and projects.

## How it's' made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS and JavaScript

This is my first ever coding project. We just started learning basic HTML and CSS this semester, and this is the first real project we have been tasked to do. As it was my first time I was constantly learning new things and ways during the proces - which was super exciting. 

Before I started coding, I had made a complete mock-up for both mobile and desktop in Figma - this was really helpfull because I would have all the right measurements for the elements beforehand. Then I started coding the index HTML and decided to focus on the header and footer first. I have used flex for bacically everything in this project. As soon as I had completed the header and footer, I created the other HTML pages for the project. This way I could start creating the links between the pages. When creating the content for the pages I struggled the most with the index page and the videos displayed in the projects file. The placement of the illustrations on the index page was really hard to understand, but after a lot of different tries I finally figured it out! As I inserted the video and animation it messed up the whole layout. I decided to not make the animation with CSS. Instead I took my spritesheet into a gif maker, made the gif then made it into a video. This way I would only have to figure out how to fix the video in the layout. After trying different things and searching, I found a solution - I was do happy in that moment! 

Then came the JavaScript for all my elements that was supposed to 'fold out' a description when clicking an arrow, and the menu button for mobile. We haven't had lessons in JavaScript yet, so I got someone to explain it to me. At first I felt so stupid because I just couldn't wrap my head around it. As we tried to make something work It started to make a little sense. Then I tried to make the rest by trying to copy what we made together, and it almost worked the first time! As I made it more times, it made more and more sense - although I have tons of comments in my JS file, this is just for me to keep understanding what everything does. JavaScript it is really a different way of thinking. 

Through the proces I kept going back and forth and editing things I had already done. The inspect tool in the browser has been a great way to check if things work as intended, and a great way to experiment if something isn't working right. This project definitely tested me, but I am so satisfied with the end result. Coding is not so bad afterall, and I definitely want to do more projects later on. 

## Optimizations

One of the requirements for the project was specifically image optimization. I have optimized all images, and that includes all svg files. I decided to change most jpg. files to webp. Webp files are specifically made for the web, and by using this type of file I was able to create smaller, richer images - perfect to make it faster to load. I just used an image converter to make the images go from their original filetype to webp. 
For the svg files I used SVGOMG https://svgomg.net/
For the img files I used CloudConvert https://cloudconvert.com/
